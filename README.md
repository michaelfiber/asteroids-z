# Asteroids Z

This was put together one weekend because I felt like making a joke game in the style of an 80s 
vector art arcade game. Please do not take it too seriously, it was a joke created during the 
pandemic.

It is written in TypeScript for any modern browser to use. It just uses the canvas API without
any external libraries or dependencies.

There's a playable version of it [here](https://michaelfiber.itch.io/asteroids-zeneca).
